                        Those who earn the Google Cybersecurity Certificate have completed eight courses, developed by
                        Google, that include hands-on, practice-based assessments and are designed to prepare them for
                        entry-level roles in cybersecurity. They are competent in beginner-level Python, Linux, SQL, Security
                        Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). They know
                        how to identify common cybersecurity risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, as well as the techniques to
                        mitigate.
