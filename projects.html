                        JavaScryption was a semester long group project for Software Engineering I (CEN 3031) with the goal of
                        working as a team to create a game using only Java. Our group took inspiration from an indie game called
                        "Inscription" and worked hard to recreate it using JavaFX API.
                        I worked predominately on the UX/UI.

                        Nature-Dex was the capstone project for my time in university. The goal of the project was to make a website
                        where users could post images and descriptions of wildlife that could be found in their local area. To make this come to life,
                        we decided to combine a React.JS frontend with a ASP.NET backend to have full control over the entire process. Additionally, we incorporated
                        Google OAuth for authentication, PostgreSQL for our database, and Wikimedia API for details on species.

                        Tetris: Bot Attack is an unafiliated solo project I worked on to learn the Godot game engine.
                        The game features all of the modern game mechanics expected of a Tetris clone, as well as
                        a robot that reacts to how well you play. The game also includes accessibility options, such
                        as full controller configuration.

                        The Custom Chat Creator was a semester long group project for Client-Side Programming (COP 4864) with the goal
                        of using the React.JS framework to make a responsive website. Our website allows for users to fill out form elements
                        to create custom CSS code that can be used for streamer chat boxes. I worked predominately on the custom CSS maker 
                        and responsive CSS code.
