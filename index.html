                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Nate Bouchat, and I am currently going into my last year for my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity (Expected graduation Spring 2024).
                    Along the way I have picked up a minor in both Computer Science and Art, as well as earned multiple different Certifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My desire to make a difference in the world is what drives me to do Cybersecurity.
                    The world is ever-evolving, and bad actors will always try to find a new way to do their nefarious deeds.
                    The best part of Cybersecurity is that feeling when you stopped the bad guys from ever touching the assets that you kept safe.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Additionally, I've always loved making things, and making software is no different! In my free time I enjoy creating my own game projects.
                    This includes making all of the code and assets and trying to make the experience as enjoyable as possible.
                    Some examples of these projects can be found on my "Projects" tab or more directly on
                    <a href="https://github.com/natebouchat">GitHub</a> .
